## Entries

### Week 1

- **10/1/24**: Created the repository and initialized it with a basic README.md. Set up the structure for the portfolio with the required `code/` directory and `notebook.md`. Pushed initial commit to GitHub/GitLab.

- **10/3/24**:
    - Wrote some class notes and examples (see [notes folder](./notes/))
    - Wrote a little project to turn audio into spectrograms, and spectrograms back into audio, using FFT and DFFT. See [here](./code/fft/)

### Week 2
- **10/8/24**:
    - Wrote some class notes and examples (see [notes folder](./notes/))
    - Implemented the 'Clipped' homework assignment.

### Week 3
- **10/15/24**: Watched lecture videos

### Week 3
- **10/22/24**: Wrote some class notes and examples (see [notes folder](./notes/))

### Week 4
- **10/29/24**: Wrote some class notes and examples (see [notes folder](./notes/))
- **10/29/24**: Started imlementing a svelte project for adaptive tone control (now replaced with a python implementaiton) (see [here](./code/adaptive-tone-control/))
- **11/1/24 - 11/4/24**: Researched MIDI 1.0 standard, for implementing in '[SynthSynth](./code/SynthSynth/)
- **11/1/24 - 11/4/24**: Partially implemented a final project idea called '[SynthSynth](./code/SynthSynth)' (this was eventually dropped in favor of Interpolator).

### Week 5
- **11/4/24**:
- **11/5/24**: Did some initial research into a final project idea involving simulating human mouth noises
- **11/7/24**: Finished initial mouth sim research. Decided to focus on interpolating between continuous vowel noises.

### Week 7
- **11/26/24**: Wrote some class notes (see [notes folder](./notes/)).
- **11/26/24**: Replaced unfinished svelte implementation of adaptive-tone-control with a python implementation (see [here](./code/adaptive-tone-control/)).
- **11/26/24 - 11/27/24**: Implemented most of the requested features for the popgen assignment (see [here](./code/popgen/)).
- **11/28/24**: Started work on final project [interpolator](./code/interpolator/). Implemented magnitude, phase and formant interpolation.

### Week 8
- Researched various spectral morphing methods for use in [interpolator](./code/interpolator/).

### Week 9
- **10/6/24 - 10/8/24**: Continued work on final project [interpolator](./code/interpolator/). Implemented pitch shifting.

### Week 10
- **10/10/24**: Completed [interpolator](./code/interpolator/).
