    "\n",
    "Strings under tension vibrate at a frequency determined by their length and frequency. Higher resonances occur at frequencies determined by integer divisions of the string.\n",

    "Where $T$ is the tension, p is the mass per unit length, and m is the total mass.\n",

    "## Human Voice\n",
    "\n",
    "The human vocal tract works by vibrating vocal folds (chords), and those vibrations resonating in cavities within the body.\n",

    "\n",
    "Converting sound pressure to voltage allows us to transmit it over larger distances, amplify it, manipulate it and store it. \n",
